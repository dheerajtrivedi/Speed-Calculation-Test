            <p>This is a very simple quiz where you calculation speed will be tested. You will get 20 single digit mathematical problems. Your time will be recorded, answer as quickly as you can.</p>
            <p>Initially it was designed to help me to improve my calculation speed for CAT examination. Unfortunately currently we do not have much customization and most of this is hard-coded. But in future we may add some more features and option so stay tuned!</p>
            <p>All the best!</p>
