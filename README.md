# Speed-Calculation-Test

A simple quiz  to test calculation speed! 

Started this project to get a taste of web development. At the time of writing this, the quiz is pretty basic although my aim is to create a sophisticated app that adapts question according to the level of the user. 

Here is a brief list of items that I wish to implement in this project: 

- [x] Add different type of question sets like squares, divisibility etc
- [ ] Add smoother transitions to windows
- [ ] Analyse time taken per question and wrong answers to detect weak points of the quiz taker.
- [ ] Draw performance graph
